TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the same way you always do. Thatâ€™s because TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript and works with any browser, any host, and any operating system. It adds a variety of helpful tools and syntax to an already mature language, bringing the power and productivity of open-source, object-oriented development to fully compatible, core JavaScript.

In this course, Jess Chadwick teaches you how to leverage the full power of the TypeScript language in your JavaScript applications. Revisit some of the JavaScript fundamentals before turning to the data types, classes, generics, modules, and decorators that are unique to TypeScript. Get tips on defining complex types, extending and extracting metadata from existing types, and working with JavaScript modules to make your code more efficient. You can even try out your new TypeScript skills with the practice challenges along the way.
